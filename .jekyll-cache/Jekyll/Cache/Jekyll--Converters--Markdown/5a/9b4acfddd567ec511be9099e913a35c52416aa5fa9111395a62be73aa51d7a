<p>Welcome to my tiny corner of the internet. Put some pillows down, make yourself at home and most importantly, enjoy your stay.</p>

<p>I’m one of the many people who’ve jumped on the coding bandwagon, and am working towards my first developer role. I attended a bootcamp and have just finished at the end of this year, so I’m navigating my way towards finding my first role.</p>

<p>Although I can’t say I’ve got a whole wealth of programming knowledge behind me, I do hope everyone is able to learn one or two things from my posts. And if not, well, you’ve got a new buddy in the tech space - Hi!!</p>

<p>We’ll</p>

<p>🧘🏻‍♀️ Yoga <br />
🏋🏽‍♂️ Going to the gym <br />
🌱 Taking care of my plants</p>

<p>If it’s time for you to head off, come and join our community on twitter. I love talking to the dev community there - I joined for the #100DaysofCode challenge and never left because everyone was so supportive and friendly.</p>

<p>See you soon.</p>
