I"Y<p>I had a chat with my friend recently about the state of badminton websites in our local area and it was eye-opening (in the worst way). This project is a result of that conversation. <!--break--></p>

<p>One of my friends has been playing badminton for a few years now. Whenever he wanted to play, he would have to scour the local facebook pages and websites to find out if there were any sessions available that night. Not only that, there was no information on whether memberships were required, or if there were any services at the location - ie. eftpos only, on-site parking. This is where I got the idea of creating a social badminton website, used to aggregrate information about clubs and sessions currently in Queensland (Brisbane only for now).</p>

<p>Originally, I wanted to wait and learn some javascript frameworks to create this app, but since now is as good a time as any, I just went ahead. To my surprise, there was a lot of basic rails information that I’d already forgotten but with the help of some pre-made templates and the rails docs my project was on it’s way!</p>

<p>Today, I worked on visualising the relational database by drawing the columns and connections.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, I created my rails app with the help of a Le Wagon template which already includes the devise, font-awesome and simple form gems pre-installled</li>
  <li>Then I created my database tables</li>
  <li>Created a basic seedfile to test the relationships between the objects and ensure the models had the correct validations included</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the information I learned today:</p>

<h3 id="some-useful-rails-commands">Some useful rails commands</h3>
<p>I’ll use creating a house object as an example (where ‘user’ is the owner)</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rails generate model House address, age:integer, user:references
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li>With the references data_type, rails will automatically create a column called user_id and generate the foreign keys in the schema</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rails g migration AddOccupantsToHouse occupants:integer
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li>Adding ‘occupants’ column to the House model</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rails destroy migration RemoveOccupantsFromHouse
rails destroy model House occupants:integer
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li>Both commaned remove the ‘occupants’ column from the House model</li>
</ul>

<p>For tomorrow: my task will to be generate the controllers and corresponding views, maybe set up cloudinary and design the show pages for clubs and locations</p>

<p>Signing off for today, thanks for reading!</p>
