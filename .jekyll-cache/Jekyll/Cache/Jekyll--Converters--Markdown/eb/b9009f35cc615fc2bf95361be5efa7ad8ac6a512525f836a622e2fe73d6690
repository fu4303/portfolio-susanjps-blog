<p>Welcome to my tiny corner of the internet, I hope you enjoy your stay.</p>

<p>I’m one of the many people who’ve jumped on the coding bandwagon, and am working towards my first developer role. I attended a bootcamp and have just finished at the end of this year, so I’m navigating my way towards finding my first role.</p>

<p>Although I can’t say I’ve got a whole wealth of programming knowledge behind me, I do hope everyone is able to learn one or two things from my posts. And if not, well, you’ve got a new buddy in the tech space - Hi!!</p>

<p>Here are a few other things I like doing when I’m not practising programming.</p>

<p>🧘🏻‍♀️ Yoga <br />
🏋🏽‍♂️ Going to the gym <br />
🌱 Taking care of my plants</p>
