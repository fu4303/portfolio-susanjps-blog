I"<p>Hey there, I’m Susan! 👋🏽 <br />
Welcome to my blog, my tiny corner of the internet where I can share little tidbits of information I learn on my journey to becoming a software developer.</p>

<p>I’ve just finished my coding bootcamp in December and am navigating my way towards my first developer role. \</p>

<p>Here are a few other things I like doing when I’m not practising programming</p>

<p>🧘🏻‍♀️ Yoga <br />
🏋🏽‍♂️ Going to the gym <br />
🌱 Taking care of my plants</p>
