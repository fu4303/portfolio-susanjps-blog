I"„<p>Jekyll is a framework used to create static websites. A static website is one where there isnâ€™t too much server-side programming. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blogs</li>
  <li>Company websites</li>
  <li>Micro-sites</li>
  <li>Educational websites
These types of websites donâ€™t need the in-depth, extensive network of heavier frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.</li>
</ul>
