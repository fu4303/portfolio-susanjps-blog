I"<<p>Jekyll is a framework that makes creating static websites super simple. A static website is one where there isn’t too much server-side programming. <!--break-->These types of websites don’t need the in-depth, extensive network of heavier frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blogs</li>
  <li>Company websites</li>
  <li>Micro-sites</li>
  <li>Educational websites</li>
</ul>

<p>As I jumped from Rails to Jekyll, the installation and syntax was relatively straight-forward - I didn’t bump into any obstacles until I tried using some of the jekyll gems - but more on that later. If you’re just beginning, the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll documentation</a> is superb. Everything is explained well with great examples to follow. If you get stuck, look there first!</p>
