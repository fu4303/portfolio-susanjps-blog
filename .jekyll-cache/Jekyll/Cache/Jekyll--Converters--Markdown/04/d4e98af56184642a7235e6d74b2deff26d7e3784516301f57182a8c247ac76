<p>Welcome to my tiny corner of the internet. Put some pillows down, make yourself at home and most importantly, enjoy your stay.</p>

<p>I’m one of the many people who’ve recently jumped on the coding bandwagon, and am working towards my first developer role. I attended a bootcamp and have just finished at the end of this year, so I’m navigating my way towards finding my first role.</p>

<p>Although I can’t say I’ve got a whole wealth of programming knowledge behind me, I do hope everyone is able to learn one or two things from my posts. And if not, well, you’ve got a new buddy in the tech space - Hi!!</p>

<p>🧘🏻‍♀️ Yoga <br />
🏋🏽‍♂️ Going to the gym <br />
🌱 Taking care of my plants</p>

<p>Stay as long as you like but if it’s time for you to head off, I’d urge you to make one last stop over on twitter and join our developer community there. There are so many - I joined for the #100DaysofCode challenge and never left because everyone was so supportive and friendly.</p>

<p>Hope to see you soon!!</p>
