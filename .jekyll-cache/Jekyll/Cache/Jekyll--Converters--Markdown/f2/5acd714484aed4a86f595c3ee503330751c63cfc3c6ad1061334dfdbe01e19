I"¿<p>Happy new year!! Itâ€™s finally 2021, and it could not have come any sooner. I think I can confidently speak for all of us when I say 2020 was a bit of a sht-show. <!--break--></p>

<p>I might start off with a mini retrospective of 2020, but Iâ€™ll try not to dwell. Collectively, 2020 was a really horrible year, but there were a few small wins that I can celebrate and I hope youâ€™ll take some time to think about yours as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>My direct family and extended family have all stayed healthy during the year</li>
  <li>I was able to be there for and provide emotional support to some of my friends who were going through some difficult times</li>
  <li>I made the decision to pursue a career in software development and am incredibly lucky to have been able to attend a full-time bootcamp to upskill</li>
  <li>I met such supportive teachers and fellow students at my bootcamp, but unfortunately still havenâ€™t been able to meet them in person as Iâ€™m in a different city :(</li>
  <li>Was able to finally attend yoga classes and have been practising pretty consistently after wanting to for the longest time</li>
</ul>

<p>It could just be the holiday season, but Iâ€™ve been so thankful for being able to see and have genuine, in-person connections with my close friends and family. To anyone who is still waiting to see their loved ones, hold on a little longer! It will get better.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s put these bittersweet memories of 2020 to rest, and welcome the new year. Hereâ€™s to 2021 - the year that weâ€™ll all be cultivating the energy to accomplish great things. To everyone who is reading, studying, hustling or building projects to become a better developer, this year will bring great success. Whether youâ€™re looking to create a start-up, to finally land that first developer role or for those of you who are taking a break to extinguish the possibility of burnout, Iâ€™m rooting for you!</p>

<p>Weâ€™re ready for you, 2021. Bring it on!</p>
