This project is a result of that conversation. &lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my friends has been playing badminton for a few years now. Whenever he wanted to play, he would have to scour the local facebook pages and websites to find out if there were any sessions available that night. Not only that, there was no information on whether memberships were required, or if there were any services at the location - ie. eftpos only or on-site parking. This is where I got the idea of creating a social badminton website, used to aggregrate information about clubs and sessions currently in Queensland (Brisbane only for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, I wanted to wait and learn some javascript frameworks to create this app, but since I was so excited about the idea, I just powered on ahead. To my surprise, there was a lot of basic rails information that I’d already forgotten but with the help of some pre-made templates and the rails docs my project was on it’s way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-did-today&quot;&gt;What I did today&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I worked on visualising the relational database by drawing the columns and connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, I created my rails app with the help of a template which already includes the devise, font-awesome and simple form gems pre-installled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created my database tables &amp;amp; schema&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a basic seedfile to test the relationships between the objects and ensure the models had the correct validations included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some of the information I came across today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-useful-rails-commands&quot;&gt;Some useful rails commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be using a house object as an example (where ‘user’ is the owner)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;House&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:references&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the references data_type, rails will automatically create a column called user_id and generate the foreign keys in the schema&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;model name is singular and capitalized&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if not datatype is included, defaults to ‘:string’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails g migration AddOccupantsToHouse occupants:integer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding ‘occupants’ column to the House model, don’t forget to specify data-type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails destroy migration RemoveOccupantsFromHouse
rails destroy model House occupants:integer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both commands remove the ‘occupants’ column from the House model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;datetime-data-type&quot;&gt;DateTime data-type&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rails includes a data-type called ‘DateTime’, which can be used when creating a column in a relational database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create seed data for a DateTime data-type, I used the following syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Date.new(2020, 1, 7, 17, 30, 00)
Date.strptime(7/1/2020 17:00, %d/%m/%Y HH:MM)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if using ‘strptime’ method you can rearrange the format and update the date to follow the new format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about DateTime in the official Rails Documentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/DateTime.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For tomorrow:&lt;/strong&gt; my task will to be generate the controllers and corresponding views, maybe set up cloudinary and design the show pages for clubs and locations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signing off for today, thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Susan Pan</name></author><category term="💼 side projects" /><category term="badminton" /><category term="app," /><category term="rails" /><summary type="html">I had a chat with my friend recently about the state of badminton websites in our local area.

It’s finally 2021, and it could not have come any sooner. I think I can confidently speak for all of us when I say 2020 was a bit of a sht-show. &lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might start off with a mini retrospective of 2020, but I’ll try not to dwell. Collectively, 2020 was a really horrible year, but there were a few small wins that I can celebrate and I hope you’ll take some time to think about yours as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My direct family and extended family have all stayed healthy during the year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was able to be there for and provide emotional support to some of my friends who were going through some difficult times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made the decision to pursue a career in software development and am incredibly lucky to have been able to attend a full-time bootcamp to upskill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I met such supportive teachers and fellow students at my bootcamp, but unfortunately still haven’t been able to meet them in person as I’m in a different city :(&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Was able to finally attend yoga classes and have been practising pretty consistently after wanting to for the longest time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could just be the holiday season, but I’ve been so thankful for being able to see and have genuine, in-person connections with my close friends and family. To anyone who is still waiting to see their loved ones, hold on a little longer! It will get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s put these bittersweet memories of 2020 to rest, and welcome the new year. Here’s to 2021 - the year that we’ll all be cultivating the energy to accomplish great things. To everyone who is reading, studying, hustling or building projects to become a better developer, this year will bring great success. Whether you’re looking to create a start-up, to finally land that first developer role or for those of you who are taking a break to extinguish the possibility of burnout, I’m rooting for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re ready for you, 2021. Bring it on!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Susan Pan</name></author><category term="💁🏻‍♀️ personal" /><category term="personal" /><summary type="html">Happy new year!!

I’ve created this so that I have my own corner of the internet to write about all the things I’ve learnt about tech. &lt;!--break--&gt;
I’m hoping to use this platform as a way for me to really bring home the core software engineering concepts while also practising my written communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the posts I create will be to document my progress on side-projects, my career journey or technical posts for new concepts that I come across. Although I’m only at the very beginning of my tech career, I hope there will be some things that you can learn from my posts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read this! Feel free to stay and have a little poke around, but don’t forget to take a break and have a quick stretch before you continue :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Susan Pan</name></author><category term="🚀 personal development" /><category term="personal" /><category term="career" /><summary type="html">Welcome to my blog!
