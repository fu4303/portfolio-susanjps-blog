A static website is one where there isn’t too much server-side programming. These types of websites don’t need the in-depth, extensive network of heavier frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. &lt;!--break--&gt; Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blogs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Company websites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Micro-sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Educational websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I jumped from Rails to Jekyll, the installation and syntax was relatively straight-forward, I didn’t bump into any obstacles until I tried using some of the jekyll gems - but more on that later. If you’re just beginning, the Jekyll documentation is superb. Everything is explained well with great examples to follow. If you get stuck, look there first!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Susan Pan</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="coding" /><summary type="html">Jekyll is a framework that makes creating static websites super simple.

I’ve created this so that I have my own corner of the internet to write about all the things I’ve learnt about tech. &lt;!--break--&gt; I hope to use this platform to solidify my understanding of software engineering concepts while practising my written communication skills, which I believe are paramount to being an exceptional engineer and educator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the posts I create will be to document my progress on side-projects, my career journey or technical posts for new concepts that I come across. Although I’m only in the beginning stages of my tech career, I hope there will be some things that you can learn from my posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my post! Feel free to stay and have a little poke around, but don’t forget to take a break and have a quick stretch before you continue :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Susan Pan</name></author><category term="personal development" /><category term="personal" /><category term="career" /><summary type="html">Welcome to my blog!
