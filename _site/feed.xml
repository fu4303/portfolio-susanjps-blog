Even though I‚Äôm quiet, I get nervous and my palms sweat like nobody‚Äôs business, I‚Äôm still incredibly drawn to public speaking and the power it has to spark emotional connection. Think of the last TED talk you saw - how did it make you feel? If your youtube algorithm is anything like mine, I felt heartbreak, pain, sadness, guilt, joy, inspiration and empowerment all bundled up in a nice 15 minute package. Just a typical day in my household, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When going through university, I didn‚Äôt have many opportunities to talk on topics that I felt passionate and inspired by, and that really came across in my content as well as my delivery. To make it worse, when I spoke I was thinking about myself. I was thinking: ‚ÄúWill they think I‚Äôm funny?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWill they like me?‚Äù - which left no room for me to think about the audience‚Äôs needs. What I should have been asking is: ‚ÄúWhat value can I add to this audience?‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHow can I create this experience so that the audience can walk away more enlightened than when they walked in?‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the suggestion of the organiser of BrisJS, I attended a global CFP (Call For Speakers) event aimed at diverse groups looking to get into the world of public speaking. The talks were interesting, informative and gave some great tips on how to start your journey of public speaking. My favourite online presentation tip is still:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thinking about your hand placement when doing gestures on camera - it may feel like you‚Äôre putting your hands a lot higher than usual but your hands usually aren‚Äôt captured if you gesture like you would in person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After attending this event and on the lead up to my first speaking event, one side of me desparately wanted to try it out while the other side worked tirelessly to emphasise the fact that I hadn‚Äôt really experienced a tech job. Both sides were valid, and that just meant the scope of my topics were severely limited, but not zero - I had to find a topic that I was comfortable presenting with my experience level. Well, wouldn‚Äôt you know, I just spent the last 6 months transitioning from a career in healthcare into tech, and more and more people were going through a similar experience. All it took was one kind community member to tell me my story was valuable and interesting, and the next minute I knew I was on zoom, about to present my first talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre considering trying out a tech talk, look around at your local community on meetup. Most communities put out a call for speakers and if you tell an organiser that it‚Äôs your first time speaking, my experience is that they are always supportive and will offer their help. The community is also incredibly supportive to new and current speakers, which definitely helps if you‚Äôre one to get nervous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All it took was for one person to tell me that they were inspired to have made it all worth it. If you‚Äôre considering doing a tech talk, this is your sign to go for it!&lt;/p&gt;

I can‚Äôt help but imagine the story as an animation feature film as the language the author uses is playful and immersive. &lt;!--break--&gt;The author has done an amazing thing to create such an animated, living world from inside of a single hotel. The pacing and introduction of characters is just enough to keep the story moving without overwhelming the reader, with each character just as important as the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the overall feel for the book is fun and lighthearted, Amor touches on quite a few difficult topics by pushing characters into the passage of time and gifting the Count the privilege of remaining as an anchor. This book was such a joy to read and touches on a range of subjects that create and exemplify the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Enjoyment and fulfilment can be found anywhere in life, if you only keep your heart and mind open to it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cultivate relationships with everyone. Cultivate them with people who share completely different perspectives on life - children, adults, elders, as these are the people that will make your understanding of the world more well-rounded and valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And finally, on supported the passions of your loved ones: ‚ÄúFor when life makes it impossible for a man to pursue his dream, he will connive to pursue them anyway.‚Äù - p.509&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou seem like something is weight on your mind. I mean, you set that brandy in motion about half an hour ago. If you‚Äôre not careful, the vortex you‚Äôve created will drill a hole right through the floor and we‚Äôll all end up in the basement.‚Äù - p.455&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAt any given moment, it is the manifestation of a thousand transitions.

Not only did Simon reinforce the importance of WHY by shouting it at me every few words,  &lt;!--break--&gt; he showed us why it‚Äôs so important to have an unwavering sense of self, and how powerful one person‚Äôs purpose can be. His anecdotes of Apple remind us of how powerful we can be when we work together and inspire each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when one‚Äôs purpose has been lost, the repercussions ripple through the company and are felt not only by the workers but also by stakeholders and consumers. A world that has lost it‚Äôs purpose is prone to manipulations for the sake of sales and for acting with only ourselves in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhen you compete against everyone else, no-one wants to help you. When you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you.‚Äù - p. 376&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading this book has helped to reinforce the idea that companies do and should always have a responsibility for their workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He introduced this idea of the golden circle - while many people work from outside in, he stressed the importance of doing the opposite. In a broader sense, he may be suggesting that everyone has their place in the world. Your strength may not be being outgoing, outspoken and inspiring to others, but there are other ways for you to make your mark on the world. I deeply relate to being a ‚ÄòHOW‚Äô person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up this book because I was struggling with finding my WHY, and although I am still searching, this book has highlighted the importance of finding that WHY and living it. Life is too short to just go through the flow, and just like when companies lose their WHY, people also begin to stagnate when they have lost their sense of purpose in the world. I will use this as a stepping stone into finding out what I personally want out of life, and how companies fit into that puzzle so that they can help me achieve those goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThere is a difference between running with all your heart with your eyes closed and running with all your heart with your eyes wide open. For three years my heart had pounded but my eyes had been closed. I had passion and energy, but I lacked focus &amp;amp; direction. I needed to remember what inspired my passion‚Äù - p. 370&lt;/p&gt;

Today, we‚Äôre tackling‚Ä¶ the Reduce method!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending months learning ruby is pretty good on the scale of things - writing variables, functions and even programs are pretty intuitive and readable. However, jumping from ruby to javascript was a steep learning curve. Whether it was the syntax, or the shift in the type of programming that‚Äôs being done, it felt like I was taking a deep dive into the ocean without knowing how to swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One function in particular haunted me - the reduce function. When browsing StackOverflow and other JS blogs for solutions, the reduce function kept rearing it‚Äôs ugly head. Every time I saw it, I would try to read about it but for some reason I just couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we‚Äôre going to learn how to use the reduce function and master it!! There‚Äôs no other choice, so kick your text editor of choice into gear and let‚Äôs get it! By the end of this tutorial, we‚Äôre going to love this function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The array.reduce() function is one that can be called on an array object. You call it on an array, and it produces a single value as the output (a single number, a single array or a single object, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 separate arguments that we need to specify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The reducer function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The start value (optional, starts at first value in array if not specificed);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reducer_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;start_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reducer_function must have the first 2 arguments, with 2 extra optional arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reducer_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This is what the skeleton of the function looks like, with all the optional arguments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reducer_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;start_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accumulator -&amp;gt; the running total of the function. For example, if we are looking to sum all of the numbers in the array, the accumulator stores the total sum after each iteration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CurrentValue -&amp;gt; the current element being processed in the array&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Index -&amp;gt; the index of the current element being processed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Array -&amp;gt; the array that reduce() was called upon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sum-all-elements-of-an-array&quot;&gt;Sum all elements of an array&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// array.reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue, index, array), start_value);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1. Substitute argument names to names specific to our problem (create the skeleton)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2. Think about how to execute reducer function. As we are summing the numbers, we can create code as follows&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this has helped to clear up how to use this function.

This project is a result of that conversation. &lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my friends has been playing badminton for a few years now. Whenever he wanted to play, he would have to scour the local facebook pages and websites to find out if there were any sessions available that night. Not only that, there was no information on whether memberships were required, or if there were any services at the location - ie. eftpos only or on-site parking. This is where I got the idea of creating a social badminton website, used to aggregrate information about clubs and sessions currently in Queensland (Brisbane only for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, I wanted to wait and learn some javascript frameworks to create this app, but since I was so excited about the idea, I just powered on ahead. To my surprise, there was a lot of basic rails information that I‚Äôd already forgotten but with the help of some pre-made templates and the rails docs my project was on it‚Äôs way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-did-today&quot;&gt;What I did today&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I worked on visualising the relational database by drawing the columns and connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, I created my rails app with the help of a template which already includes the devise, font-awesome and simple form gems pre-installled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created my database tables &amp;amp; schema&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a basic seedfile to test the relationships between the objects and ensure the models had the correct validations included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some of the information I came across today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-useful-rails-commands&quot;&gt;Some useful rails commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be using a house object as an example (where ‚Äòuser‚Äô is the owner)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-rb highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;House&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:references&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the references data_type, rails will automatically create a column called user_id and generate the foreign keys in the schema&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;model name is singular and capitalized&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if not datatype is included, defaults to ‚Äò:string‚Äô&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rb highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;migration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;AddOccupantsToHouse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;occupants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:integer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding ‚Äòoccupants‚Äô column to the House model, don‚Äôt forget to specify data-type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rb highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;destroy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;migration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;RemoveOccupantsFromHouse&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;destroy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;House&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;occupants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:integer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both commands remove the ‚Äòoccupants‚Äô column from the House model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;datetime-data-type&quot;&gt;DateTime data-type&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rails includes a data-type called ‚ÄòDateTime‚Äô, which can be used when creating a column in a relational database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create seed data for a DateTime data-type, I used the following syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-rb highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;strptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:MM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if using ‚Äòstrptime‚Äô method you can rearrange the format and update the date to follow the new format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about DateTime in the official Rails Documentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/DateTime.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For tomorrow:&lt;/strong&gt; my task will to be generate the controllers and corresponding views, maybe set up cloudinary and design the show pages for clubs and locations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signing off for today, thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Susan Pan</name></author><category term="üíº side projects" /><category term="badminton" /><category term="app," /><category term="rails" /><summary type="html">I had a chat with my friend recently about the state of badminton websites in our local area.

It‚Äôs finally 2021, and it could not have come any sooner. I think I can confidently speak for all of us when I say 2020 was a bit of a sht-show. &lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might start off with a mini retrospective of 2020, but I‚Äôll try not to dwell. Collectively, 2020 was a really horrible year, but there were a few small wins that I can celebrate and I hope you‚Äôll take some time to think about yours as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My direct family and extended family have all stayed healthy during the year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was able to be there for and provide emotional support to some of my friends who were going through some difficult times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made the decision to pursue a career in software development and am incredibly lucky to have been able to attend a full-time bootcamp to upskill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I met such supportive teachers and fellow students at my bootcamp, but unfortunately still haven‚Äôt been able to meet them in person as I‚Äôm in a different city :(&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Was able to finally attend yoga classes and have been practising pretty consistently after wanting to for the longest time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could just be the holiday season, but I‚Äôve been so thankful for being able to see and have genuine, in-person connections with my close friends and family. To anyone who is still waiting to see their loved ones, hold on a little longer! It will get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs put these bittersweet memories of 2020 to rest, and welcome the new year. Here‚Äôs to 2021 - the year that we‚Äôll all be cultivating the energy to accomplish great things. To everyone who is reading, studying, hustling or building projects to become a better developer, this year will bring great success. Whether you‚Äôre looking to create a start-up, to finally land that first developer role or for those of you who are taking a break to extinguish the possibility of burnout, I‚Äôm rooting for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre ready for you, 2021. Bring it on!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Susan Pan</name></author><category term="üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è personal" /><category term="personal" /><summary type="html">Happy new year!!

I‚Äôve created this so that I have my own corner of the internet to write about all the things I‚Äôve learnt about tech. &lt;!--break--&gt;
I‚Äôm hoping to use this platform as a way for me to really bring home the core software engineering concepts while also practising my written communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the posts I create will be to document my progress on side-projects, my career journey or technical posts for new concepts that I come across. Although I‚Äôm only at the very beginning of my tech career, I hope there will be some things that you can learn from my posts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read this! Feel free to stay and have a little poke around, but don‚Äôt forget to take a break and have a quick stretch before you continue :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Susan Pan</name></author><category term="üöÄ personal development" /><category term="personal" /><category term="career" /><summary type="html">Welcome to my blog!
