I’ve created this so that I have my own corner of the internet to write about all the things I’ve learnt about tech. &lt;!--break--&gt; I hope to use this platform to solidify my understanding of software engineering concepts while practising my written communication skills, which I believe are paramount to being an exceptional engineer and educator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the posts I create will be to document my progress on side-projects, my career journey or technical posts for new concepts that I come across. Although I’m only in the beginning stages of my tech career, I hope there will be some things that you can learn from my posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my post! Feel free to stay and have a little poke around, but don’t forget to take a break and have a quick stretch before you continue :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Susan Pan</name></author><category term="personal development" /><category term="personal" /><category term="career" /><summary type="html">Welcome to my blog!
