<p>I’m Susan, and I’m from sunny Queensland in Australia. I’m a previous health-care worker who’s passionate about the intersection between health and technology.</p>

<p>Although I can’t say that I’ve been programming since I was little, I can confidently tell you about the hours and hours of my teenage years I lost to customising my tumblr themes. Ironically, I had no interest in a career in IT back then, and the spark for it remained dim until I worked in Pharmacy. I noticed that when one small feature was forgotten, or if the UI of the app wasn’t exactly apparent, people were falling through the cracks. And all these hiccups in the system seemed like they could’ve been easily fixed.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months, and there I was powering through Harvard’s CS50 course. One thing led to another and the next thing I knew, I was on my way to completing a full-stack bootcamp. Now that that’s over, I’ve been working to build projects which help the community around me. At the moment, I’m working on a project for the badminton community in my city to facilitate better communication between organisations and social badminton players.</p>

<p>A few other things about me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I love yoga &amp; going to the gym</li>
  <li>I love Studio Ghibli movies</li>
  <li>I love plants</li>
  <li>Salt &amp; vinegar chips will be my downfall</li>
  <li>And lastly, I am so proud to be a part of the developer community. During the bootcamp, it felt amazing to be immersed in such a supportive and encouraging environment and I couldn’t have asked for a better cohort to navigate through this journey with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay as long as you like but if it’s time for you to head off, I’d urge you to make one last stop over on twitter to join the developer community there. I joined for the #100DaysofCode challenge and never left because everyone was so supportive and friendly. On the other hand, if you’ve come here from twitter, hi!!</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting, I hope to see you very soon!</p>

<p>Susan</p>
