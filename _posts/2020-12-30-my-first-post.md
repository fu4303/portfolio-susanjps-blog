Welcome to my blog! I've created this so that I have my own corner of the internet to write about all the things I've learnt about tech. <!--break-->
I'm hoping to use this platform as a way for me to really bring home the core software engineering concepts while also practising my written communication.

Most of the posts I create will be to document my progress on side-projects, my career journey or technical posts for new concepts that I come across. Although I'm only at the very beginning of my tech career, I hope there will be some things that you can learn from my posts!

Thanks for taking the time to read this! Feel free to stay and have a little poke around, but don't forget to take a break and have a quick stretch before you continue :)
