Happy new year!! It's finally 2021, and it could not have come any sooner. I think I can confidently speak for all of us when I say 2020 was a bit of a sht-show. <!--break-->

But not to worry, there's a new year ahead of us where we'll all accomplish great things!! To everyone who is reading, studying, hustling or building projects to become a better developer, this year will bring great success. Whether you are looking to create a start-up, or to finally land that first developer role that you've wanted, this will be the year.

I've been really bad at setting new years' resolutions - ironically, I'd worry so much about what I'd wear to NYE events that I'd forget about the coming year. This will be the year that I start. It's as good a time as any to do a bit of self-reflection and think about what we want to achieve and why.
