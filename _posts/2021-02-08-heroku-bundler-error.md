### Error Message in terminal:
Could not retect rake tasks
ensure you can run `$ bundle exec rake -P` against your app
and using the production group of your Gemfile.

I ran the `bundle exec rake -P` and everything worked fine, so it wasn't to do with that.

I had a look through various stack overflow comments, some blog posts and even turned to twitter to ask for help. Turns out, heroku only has a few versions of bundler that it can support, as detailed [in the Heroku Docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bundler-version)

After testing many solutions to no avail, I tweaked a few and put them all together to get this final solution:

I was using bundler v2.2.2, so had to downgrade to version 2.0.2. (To find out your bundler version you can run `bundler -v`)
- ```gem uninstall bundler```
- ```gem install bundler -v 2.0.2```
- do NOT run `bundle update --bundler`, otherwise it will upgrade it to the latest version again
- ```delete Gemfile.lock```
- ```bundle install```
- ``` ga . && gc -m "fix heroku/bundler error"```
- ``` gp origin main```
- ``` gp heroku main```
