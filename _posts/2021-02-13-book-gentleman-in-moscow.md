This book is fun and so charming. I can't help but imagine the story as an animation feature film as the language the author uses is playful and immersive. <!--break-->The author has done an amazing thing to create such an animated, living world from inside of a single hotel. The pacing and introduction of characters is just enough to keep the story moving without overwhelming the reader, with each character just as important as the next.

Although the overall feel for the book is fun and lighthearted, Amor touches on quite a few difficult topics by pushing characters into the passage of time and gifting the Count the privilege of remaining as an anchor. This book was such a joy to read and touches on a range of subjects that create and exemplify the human experience.

## ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes
>"In the time that Nina had been in the hotel, the walls had not grown inward, they had grown outward, expanding in scope and intricacy." - p.84

>"You seem like something is weight on your mind. I mean, you set that brandy in motion about half an hour ago. If you're not careful, the vortex you've created will drill a hole right through the floor and we'll all end up in the basement." - p.455

>"At any given moment, it is the manifestation of a thousand transitions. Our faculties wax and wane, our experiences accumulate, and our opinions evolve - if not glacially, then at least gradually. Such that the events of an average day are as likely to transform who we are as a pinch of pepper is to transform a stew" p.608
