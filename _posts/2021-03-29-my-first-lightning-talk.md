 I have always loved public speaking. Even though I'm quiet, I get nervous and my palms sweat like nobody's business, I'm still incredibly drawn to public speaking and the power it has to spark emotional connection. Think of the last TED talk you saw - how did it make you feel? If your youtube algorithm is anything like mine, I felt heartbreak, pain, sadness, guilt, joy, inspiration and empowerment all bundled up in a nice 15 minute package. Just a typical day in my household, really.

When going through university, I didn't have many opportunities to talk on topics that I felt passionate and inspired by, and that really came across in my content as well as my delivery. To make it worse, when I spoke I was thinking about myself. I was thinking: "Will they think I'm funny?" and "Will they like me?" - which left no room for me to think about the audience's needs. What I should have been asking is: "What value can I add to this audience?", or "How can I create this experience so that the audience can walk away more enlightened than when they walked in?".

At the suggestion of the organiser of BrisJS, I attended a global CFP (Call For Speakers) event aimed at diverse groups looking to get into the world of public speaking. The talks were interesting, informative and gave some great tips on how to start your journey of public speaking. My favourite online presentation tip is still:
 - Thinking about your hand placement when doing gestures on camera - it may feel like you're putting your hands a lot higher than usual but your hands usually aren't captured if you gesture like you would in person.

After attending this event and on the lead up to my first speaking event, one side of me desparately wanted to try it out while the other side worked tirelessly to emphasise the fact that I hadn't really experienced a tech job. Both sides were valid, and that just meant the scope of my topics were severely limited, but not zero - I had to find a topic that I was comfortable presenting with my experience level. Well, wouldn't you know, I just spent the last 6 months transitioning from a career in healthcare into tech, and more and more people were going through a similar experience. All it took was one kind community member to tell me my story was valuable and interesting, and the next minute I knew I was on zoom, about to present my first talk.

If you're considering trying out a tech talk, look around at your local community on meetup. Most communities put out a call for speakers and if you tell an organiser that it's your first time speaking, my experience is that they are always supportive and will offer their help. The community is also incredibly supportive to new and current speakers, which definitely helps if you're one to get nervous!

All it took was for one person to tell me that they were inspired to have made it all worth it. If you're considering doing a tech talk, this is your sign to go for it!
