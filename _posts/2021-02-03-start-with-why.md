I picked up this book after feeling lost and wandering through life without knowing my purpose. Not only did Simon reinforce the importance of WHY by shouting it at me every few words,  <!--break--> he showed us why it's so important to have an unwavering sense of self, and how powerful one person's purpose can be. His anecdotes of Apple remind us of how powerful we can be when we work together and inspire each other.

On the other hand, when one's purpose has been lost, the repercussions ripple through the company and are felt not only by the workers but also by stakeholders and consumers. A world that has lost it's purpose is prone to manipulations for the sake of sales and for acting with only ourselves in mind.

Reading this book has helped to reinforce the idea that companies do and should always have a responsibility for their workers.

1. He introduced this idea of the golden circle - while many people work from outside in, he stressed the importance of doing the opposite. In a broader sense, he may be suggesting that everyone has their place in the world. Your strength may not be being outgoing, outspoken and inspiring to others, but there are other ways for you to make your mark on the world. I deeply relate to being a 'HOW' person.

I picked up this book because I was struggling with finding my WHY, and although I am still searching, this book has highlighted the importance of finding that WHY and living it. Life is too short to just go through the flow, and just like when companies lose their WHY, people also begin to stagnate when they have lost their sense of purpose in the world. I will use this as a stepping stone into finding out what I personally want out of life, and how companies fit into that puzzle so that they can help me achieve those goals.

For three years my heart had pounded but my eyes had been closed. I had passion and energy, but I lacked focus & direction. I needed to remember what inspired my passion" - p. 370
